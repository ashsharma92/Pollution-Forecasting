# Pollution-Forecasting
SARIMA model to predict pollution levels 

AIM: To create a Time Series Forecast on Pollution data from a locality within New Delhi India.

WHY?: I am personally interested to see how this can be done and as a result what the possible implications could be if I worked within enviromental department looking at historical pollution levels.

The dataset had a lot of features I could have focussed on but I chose to look at Particulate Matter 2.5."Particulate matter" (PM) or "particle pollution" is a mixture of tiny solid particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air. These particles come in various sizes and shapes and can be composed of hundreds of different chemicals.The "2.5" in PM2.5 refers to its size. PM2.5 are fine inhalable particles with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers (µm) or less.

PM2.5 particles can originate from various sources, both natural and human-made:

Combustion sources: This is a major contributor. Vehicle exhausts (cars, trucks, buses) Industrial processes (power plants, factories) Burning wood (wood heaters, wildfires) Agricultural burning Complex atmospheric reactions: Many particles form in the atmosphere as a result of chemical reactions between pollutants like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides (from power plants, industries, and vehicles). Other sources: Dust, dirt, soot, smoke. 4. Why is PM2.5 a concern for health?

Because of their extremely small size, PM2.5 particles are the most dangerous air pollutant:

Deep lung penetration: Unlike larger particles (PM10) that tend to get filtered in the nose and throat or settle in the upper airways, PM2.5 particles are so small they can travel deep into your respiratory tract, reaching the deepest parts of your lungs. Entry into bloodstream: Some particles can even pass from the lungs into the bloodstream and be transported throughout the body, affecting various organs. Serious health impacts: Exposure to PM2.5 is linked to a wide range of severe health problems, both short-term and long-term: Respiratory issues: Asthma attacks, acute and chronic bronchitis, reduced lung function, coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath. Cardiovascular problems: Increased risk of heart attacks, strokes, irregular heartbeats, increased hospital admissions for heart disease. Other serious conditions: Lung cancer, lower respiratory infections (like pneumonia), type 2 diabetes, adverse birth outcomes, and emerging evidence suggests links to dementia. Vulnerable populations: Children, older adults, pregnant women, and individuals with pre-existing heart or lung diseases are particularly sensitive to PM2.5 exposure. 5. How is PM2.5 measured?

PM2.5 concentrations are typically measured in micrograms per cubic meter of air (μg/m 3).
